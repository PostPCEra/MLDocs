### Brain size increases rapidly From 800,000–200,000 years ago

- I think brain size increase 1000 cc to 1400 cc in that 600,000 years
- Human brain size [evolved most rapidly during a time of dramatic climate change](http://humanorigins.si.edu/human-characteristics/brains). Larger, more complex brains enabled early humans of this time period to interact with each other and with their surroundings in new and different ways. As the environment became more unpredictable, bigger brains helped our ancestors survive.
