## Formation of Solar System & Earth

### Bigbang

### formation on stars

### formation of plant Earth

## Life on Earth



### single Cell
- [A December 2017 report stated that 3.45 billion year old](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism) Australian rocks once contained microorganisms, the earliest direct evidence of life on Earth
- Microorganisms include all `unicellular organisms` and so are extremely diverse. Of the three domains of life identified by Carl Woese, all of the Archaea and Bacteria are microorganisms.


### Multi Cell

### Reproduction by ...

### Eyes

### Vertebrate & body plan
- an animal of a large group distinguished by `the possession of a backbone or spinal column,` including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fishes.
 - carwl
 - limbs 
 
### BiPedel

### Primates

 
## Human Society

### 3 Revolutions : Cog , Ag , Sci


3 Revoltions as per [Sapiens book author](https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0062316095)

| Revolution |  Time period | Brain size | duration      |
| -------    | -----     |      ----  | ---------  |
| Cognitive  | 7 ma - 1 ma| 400 cc to 1000 cc  | 6 million years  |
| Agriculture  | -60,000 to 100 AD | 1200 to 1400 cc  | 60,000 years  |
| Scientific  | 1300 to 1900 AD |  same as Ag  | 600 years  |
| AI Revolution  | 2040 to 2100 AD |  same as Sci  | 60  years  |

Ai Revolution is a kind of `Cognitive` revolution, but this time, it not for animals(humans ),but for Machines . So it is cognitive 
revolution for Machines .


### Brain size increases rapidly From 800,000–200,000 years ago

- I think brain size increase 1000 cc to 1400 cc in that 600,000 years
- Human brain size [evolved most rapidly during a time of dramatic climate change](http://humanorigins.si.edu/human-characteristics/brains). Larger, more complex brains enabled early humans of this time period to interact with each other and with their surroundings in new and different ways. As the environment became more unpredictable, bigger brains helped our ancestors survive.

- Evolutionary psychology is the combination of two sciences -- evolutionary biology and cognitive psychology’.
- [Evolutionary psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_psychology)Evolutionary psychology is an approach that views human nature as the product of a universal set of evolved psychological adaptations to recurring problems in the ancestral environment.
