## List various UI & UX samples for inspiration 

#### 1. Folder and File menu
- use [codesandbox File menu](https://codesandbox.io/s/kyl0z8yv5?from-embed) as it works well and also good UX.
- code is on [Github](https://github.com/CompuIves/codesandbox-client) -- find which soruce FILE related to "File" menu on scren

#### 2. single page FAQ or explantation page 
- Recurse FAQ page with [Right hand menu](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sec-environment) : View soruce shows so many &nbsp; etc.. take as it .
- Replace hard code with Mobx/React and generate as Static page. Or use some simple templage language like JINJA

#### 7.Chat vs. Forum 
- if Forum then Discourse is way to go. Mostly this will do it. If we need CHAT then seems Zulip is one good one
- Recurse is using Zulip (said on above page), also Zulip mentiond it on Zulip web site
