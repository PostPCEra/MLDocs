## List various UI & UX samples for inspiration 

#### 1. single page FAQ or explantation page 
- Recurse FAQ page with [Right hand menu](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sec-environment) : View soruce shows so many &nbsp; etc.. take as it .
- Replace hard code with Mobx/React and generate as Static page. Or use some simple templage language like JINJA

#### Chat vs. Forum 
- if Forum then Discourse is way to go. Mostly this will do it. If we need CHAT then seems Zulip is one good one
- Recurse is using Zulip (said on above page), also Zulip mentiond it on Zulip web site
