## Modern JS with ES6

> ES6 is every thing and every where, there is place for  `old school Javascript` in 2018 . The year 2017 consolidated the emergence of ES6 in all JS projects.

 
[Modern JS with ES6](https://www.slideshare.net/KevinLangleyJr/modern-js-with-es6?qid=ae112fd3-0cf6-471f-847d-22e6074b3c08&v=&b=&from_search=6) : latest deck of 2018 with 200 slides
 
- on `Slide #56` : use `Const` by default , Only use `Let` when rebinding is needed , no place for `var` in ES6

## React Eco System 

> The concept of `Virtual DOM` is an untapped `abstraction` in the browser, waiting to be discovered for a decade . This untapped abstraction is manifested in React Js. Any untapped abstraction has to come out, it is only matter of time.

[Analogy : Ballons in the Room](https://www.cronj.com/blog/virtual-dom-react-js/)

`Complexity Comparison:`
Regular DOM take O(n^3) for generating Updated DOM where Virtual DOM is O(n) to almost all practical user cases.


All the JS frame works Angular, Vue implemented React famous feature that is `Virtual DOM`

### React Component Libraries 
 - [React.Rocks](https://react.rocks/?q=form) components : search by keyword out of 1000
 
### Production ready Project code base Repos
 - [Realword React Mobx](https://github.com/gothinkster/react-mobx-realworld-example-app)


## JavaScript Libraries

- [Javascripting.com](https://www.javascripting.com/forms/) : The definitive source of the best JavaScript libraries, frameworks, and plugins.


## Mobx

- Who is using Mobx: [Coinbase  & others using in production](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx/issues/681)

## Real time Search

[Why ElasticSearch Why not MongoDB](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-an-airbnb-clone-with-react-and-elasticsearch?utm_source=mybridge&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=read_more)
 
>  Elasticsearch is the #1 search engine - if your use-case involves searching data, it's a great choice and offers more flexibility than almost any other system.
> It's also blazing fast (a consequence of it being a search engine) with aggregations `because it indexes all data`, as opposed to letting a user define what data gets indexed.

  Better to have `Search` pages of website with ElasticSearch (appbase.io) or Algolia . If you use regular DB , it won't provide RealTime Search.
 
 

 - [Algolia Integration libraries](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/) : with Django and Rails 
 - [Algolia Tutorials](https://www.algolia.com/doc/tutorials/) : much advanced than below appbase.io .
 - [Appbase React UI components](https://github.com/appbaseio/reactivesearch#4-live-demos) using appbase.io & Elastic Search
 - [AirBnB clone with React](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-an-airbnb-clone-with-react-and-elasticsearch?utm_source=mybridge&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=read_more) : good code to learn
