### Organising Personal Knowledge (notes)

##### Tools 
- Inspiration from Gordon: http://gordonbrander.com/pattern/
- Static site generators : [two popular ones](https://www.fullstackpython.com/static-site-generator.html) a) Pelican based: [fullstack python site](https://github.com/mattmakai/fullstackpython.com). b) Mkdocs  based: example [Django REST site](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/#api-guide). In MkDocs based seems good for Programmig guides like above Django REST API, where one full page LEFT menu links are same page with # anchors.  
- We go with Pelican, so is [recommended by this review](http://maxpearl.us/review-of-python-open-source-static-site-generators.html). Gordon used his own satic site generator, it is on his github repos. For us Pelican should do it
