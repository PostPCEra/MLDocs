### Organising Personal Knowledge (notes)

Everything around me was someone's lifework| Intelligence is the capacity for learning| Entrepreneur at heart(CS grad), broadly curious. I live & breathe EdTech


An Animal of No Significance : Just 6 million years ago, a single female ape had two daughters. One became the ancestor of all chimpanzees, the other is our own grandmother.
Nobody had any inkling that their descendants would one day walk on the moon, split the atom, fathom the genetic code and write history books. 

Three important revolutions shaped the course of history: The Cognitive Revolution (70,000 years ago), The Agricultural Revolution(12,000 years ago) and Scientific Revolution(500 years ago)

Intelligence is the capacity for Learning. 

because all these facets of Intelligence can be obtained through Learning 

Intelligence is one's capacity for logic, understanding, self-awareness, learning, emotional knowledge, reasoning, planning, creativity, and problem solving.

In my whole life, I have known no wise people (over a broad subject matter area) who didn’t read all the time — none. Zero. — Charlie Munger
The best way to achieve wisdom is to learn the big ideas that underlie reality. — Charlie Munger

##### Tools 
- Inspiration from Gordon: http://gordonbrander.com/pattern/
- Static site generators : [two popular ones](https://www.fullstackpython.com/static-site-generator.html) a) Pelican based: [fullstack python site](https://github.com/mattmakai/fullstackpython.com). b) Mkdocs  based: example [Django REST site](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/#api-guide). In MkDocs based seems good for Programmig guides like above Django REST API, where one full page LEFT menu links are same page with # anchors.  
- We go with Pelican, so is [recommended by this review](http://maxpearl.us/review-of-python-open-source-static-site-generators.html). Gordon used his own satic site generator, it is on his github repos. For us Pelican should do it

##### Format
- Have TOPIC content stored in YAML or similar format file, and let plug-in read and transform the content
- for UI page: Have Anchor links on top of page
```
   Learing , Feynmen (get from Gordon) , How Learning Works
   
   Abstracition , Library/Framework , 
```
- for a concept like 'Intelligence is capacity for Learning' when hover (or click) show popup with full content , that way easy navigation, not loosig context of current page. Use JS Lib for easy popup ..

- show images small as 100x100 px, when clicked show big popup image
- echo of these will have their own page: 
```
  Bookself 
  Stars, Evolution, World history 
  Autonomus vehicles, Renewable Energy : use BNEF tweets of total EV cars, EV buses stats, Solar/wind stats
```
- Have a Twitter dump into files with download , and use my best/popular tweets text, images and links
- for a page like 'Autonous vehicles', we can have page like this will 'References' at the bottom http://gordonbrander.com/pattern/conversational-ui/
- Have one page for all awesome quotes
```
Sapiens : 3 Revolutions : cognitive, agricultural, scientific (last one AI, starting 2050 where machine really write software)
  - they never thought one day their anchestors  split atom, send man to moon etc..
  
 Intelligence is capacity for Learning ... coz all other facets of of intelligence can be achieved/manifested through leraring . ( my tweet )
 
 Writing : Writig enabled human to have external memory  (gordon )
 
 Smalletst unit of living being : cell, Smallest unit of any material : atom, so editing of these are the last Frontiers of technological advnacement of any society ( aliens or otherwise) in universe:
  - so : DNA Editing (CSPR), nano technology ( to edit atoms), the third part is : AI ( which is exponential learning system)
  
 For 4 billion years, Life on earth (Evolution) followed 2 simple principles : Random mutations and Natural selection. Now can human interventation to natural selection by doing delibarate selection
