## AI

### ML


### DL

### Good example and code base
- RL : Reinforcement Learing - Bee hive and smoke tutorial ( see if we can apply this Environment knowlege tecnique to stock price with Yahoo analyst median forecast and Zacks Rank , also Quarter-result-Day-Price arbitrage for put/call combo )
- LSTM : is a subset of RNN , good suited for Time series Forecasting ( see Kaggle examples ) , see if we can combine LSTM with above RL 
- 
- Tensorflow basket shooting - intro to gitu ( also newyouk home prices on Medium as I tweeted )
- [Intro to DL](http://introtodeeplearning.com/) - MIT course 8 Series youtube and Slides
