### The 15-point DevOps Check List

> Culture Of [Continual Experimentation And Learning](https://medium.com/devopslinks/the-15-point-devops-check-list-8cd2afb4a448)

- Shorter Development Cycles & Time-To-Market
- Time-to-market (TTM) is the length of time it takes from the conception stage to the product being deployed and running in production servers.
 
| Topic           | Notes | 
| --------------- | ------|
| config in VCS | You system configuration should be always into a source control service/servers| 
| Prod-like systems | Developers should be able to create systems with production-like configurations and data| 
| Dev access to CI | Developers should have access to continuous integration tasks to build softwares and test artifacts in a short period: I prefer working with git hooks, where an automatic build is launched right when a developer push a change to development branch|

### Ansible


| Title | What | Notes | 
| ------- | -----| ----  | 
| Ansible begginer 5 videos| great hands-on | [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLLumGsi1QboyiFIJf8a-0w)
| Ansible slide deck | read  basics | [slides](https://www.slideshare.net/GulcinYildirim/managing-postgresql-with-ansible-fosdem-pgday-2016)
| Simple Ansible Playbook | helps learn Ansible basics | [github](https://github.com/myarik/django-ansible-setup)   |

| Ansible Playbook for setting up a Djang | Full blown| [gold standard](https://github.com/jcalazan/ansible-django-stack)  | 

first try with item #1 to understand fundamentals of Ansible , then finally #3

So how can I use Ansible?
> In the simplest form, you need three components: an Ansible server, remote hosts and a playbook.

## 2. CI & CD

> Unlike compiled languages, [Python doesnâ€™t need a "build" per se](https://jenkins.io/solutions/python/). 
Python projects can still benefit greatly from using Jenkins for continuous integration and delivery.


Except Java and C, other Languages doesn't have `Build` per se. The list goes on Python/PHP/Ruby, Javascript ... That is the reason `Jenkins` origions are so much JAVA Build system centered .
 
An [Introduction to CI/CD Best Practices](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-ci-cd-best-practices)
 
### 2.1 Jenkins

Configuring a [Jenkins Pipeline using a YAML file ](https://jenkins.io/blog/2018/04/25/configuring-jenkins-pipeline-with-yaml-file/)
 - the above is experimental, but shows promise of Jenkin config coming to YMAL 


### 2.2 BuildBot

After Jenkin, python based CI Server [BuildBot]() is popular [as per this](https://blog.taiga.io/6-excellent-continuous-integration-tools.html).

`BuildBot` is used by `Mozilla, Webkit, Chromium`

| How To Set Up Continuous Integration with Buildbot on Ubuntu 16.04 | [Digital ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-continuous-integration-with-buildbot-on-ubuntu-16-04) |
| | |

`Conclusion : `
In this tutorial, we configured Buildbot to listen for changes to a GitHub repository using webhooks. When a change is received, Buildbot starts up a container based on a custom Docker image to test the new commit. The Docker image contains a Buildbot worker instance as well as the dependencies needed to test our project code. This allows Buildbot to dynamically start Buildbot workers as needed whenever a change is made to the repository.
 
  
### 2.3 hosted CI tool vendors 
  Circle CI, Travis CI 


[DevOps Toolbox](https://hostadvice.com/blog/devops-toolbox-jenkins-ansible-chef-puppet-vagrant-saltstack/) - some good tools parts showing Jenkins can integrate all CI/CD Ecosystem ( some of that integration may be only available in CloudBees not in FOSS Jenkins), but CI coluld host vendors `Travis CI` `Circle CI` etc are 
missing. It seems this post is promoting more of sponsers of the website like CloudBee (Enterprise Jenkins) etc..


## 3. Test Automation

###  VCS : Bitbucket & github
Version Control System VCS

###  Jest - Client side

###  NightWatch - Browser E2E 

Node.js powered End-to-End testing framework


###  Pytest - Server  side
    python functional testing
