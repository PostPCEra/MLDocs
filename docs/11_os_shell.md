### ngrok
  - [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) : Expose your localhost to the web 
  - Watch all HTTP Traffic data between browser and server on port 4000, and repeat any browser actions with `repeat button`. 
  This saves so much time with Ajax calls from browser as you do not need to `repeat all steps` on browser, instead simply press repeat.
  - on browser

## Editors
-  Pycharm : has built-in Markdown Editor, VCS built-in (git commit/push), multi-cursor , good Python debugging `so use it `
- VsCode, Atom, Sublime need many plug-ins and still not as good as Pycharm
- if you are using `data intensive apps` and `graphs` may go for Spyder
