## Group 1

### gmail
 - we have one paid acct  @masteryle-x-.com check 
### AirTable (Trello out of favour)
- AirTable is much better than Trello. We struggled with Trello for these tasks account id/pwd details, Task with actions ( example : Newhire steps)
- The main reason for Trello Struggle is `it does not offer Tabular view`, all details are hidden except `one top line`
- Where as with Airtable, with a glance you can have mental picture .
- It works with Project management tasks, moving tasks between people ( they get notified)

## Group 2

### Slack
- If we ever need to offer RT communication to our users (as part of website), there are FOSS Zulip and Rocket.chat 

### Discourse
 - $20 for one click install on Digital ocean, even if you go other hosting place still same. Rails and DB need 2GB+ RAM
