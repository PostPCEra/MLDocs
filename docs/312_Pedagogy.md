## Pedagogy


### Why Python

Why not other langs. Well Python has these huge list of advantages . (read 5 big items). Just kidding . this is how so many websites teaching programming will talk to you.

we are different. We will never ever UTTER a WORD, which you DO NOT Understand. period, that is our Promise.

Story time .... Tell a story ...
Here is Google Eng. Dir .. give link
 - if you have a friend who can help, learn that language
 - else Learn Python ...
 

### Competency Levels

Earlier, we thought of `competency levels` as 101, 201, 301  (in google keep) . Those number may not click well with all international users.
A Better metaphor may be using some thing well known such as  Chess piece names such as `Pawn 1 `  Pawn 2, Pawn3, Bishop, Knight, Rook, Queen with each level carrying 1,2,3.

It seems Levels 1,2,3 may be easy to comprehend than having 5 levels such as 1,2,3,4,5 ( too many, user get confused). Also with 3 levels there 
is a sense of achievement like if one mastered each level in one month then that is total 5 months. 


### Weekend tests
4 Tests every weekend that is 2 tests on Saturday and 2 Tests on Sunday. These are tests with hand written on paper and are peer graded against different quality metrics.
correctness of the program, meaningful variable names, easy to understand Logic

If you worry about giving upload access to an unknown site, you can attach attach the Pictures of Test to a gmail and mail to us. In the mail Subject, 
just put your studentID followed by TestID ( space separated). Just attach images, Nothing else in email coz Bot program does not read any thing else .

### Time allocation

If one spends 
```
Mon - Fri : 2.5 hours/day -> 2.5 x 5 days  = 12.5
Sat - Sun : 5 hours/day   -> 5   x 2 days = 10

Total hours/week : 22.5 
Total hours/month : 90 hours 
```

If you are a student or employee and you can not get those 22 hours/week, share how your time is allocated as of today, community may suggest you
how to get your tasks done in less time or all together ditch those time wasting tasks ( FB, Social media etc..)

We all need 8 hours sleep, 2 hours total for other essentials like ( eating food + shower + etc ). Anything else  that begs your time you have to question .
