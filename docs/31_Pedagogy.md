## Pedagogy


### Why Python

Why not other langs. Well Python has these huge list of advantages . (read 5 big items). Just kidding . this is how so many websites teaching programming will talk to you.

we are different. We will never ever UTTER a WORD, which you DO NOT Understand. period, that is our Promise.

Story time .... Tell a story ... get good story where sequence does not matter but `mastering craft` does

Here is Google Eng. Dir .. give link
 - if you have a friend who can help, learn that language
 - else Learn Python ...
 

I won't promise you will get a job in a high tech company in few months

what I promise is, you are confident you know certain level of programming, you also know 'what is making programming hard to learn'. 
Once you know those, you are on your path to master programming ..


### Competency Levels

Earlier, we thought of `competency levels` as 101, 201, 301  (in google keep) . Those number may not click well with all international users.
A Better metaphor may be using some thing well known such as  Chess piece names such as `Pawn 1 `  Pawn 2, Pawn3, Bishop, Knight, Rook, Queen with each level carrying 1,2,3.

It seems Levels 1,2,3 may be easy to comprehend than having 5 levels such as 1,2,3,4,5 ( too many, user get confused). Also with 3 levels there 
is a sense of achievement like if one mastered each level in one month then that is total 5 months. 

**how Chess Rating is used in other systems**

- Chess [Rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_rating_system)
- Here chess books, based on comptency level [pawn to Queen](https://chess4life.com/resources-by-level/) 

### Weekend tests
4 Tests every weekend that is 2 tests on Saturday and 2 Tests on Sunday. These are tests with hand written on paper and are peer graded against different quality metrics.
correctness of the program, meaningful variable names, easy to understand Logic

If you worry about giving upload access to an unknown site, you can attach attach the Pictures of Test to a gmail and mail to us. In the mail Subject, 
just put your studentID followed by TestID ( space separated). Just attach images, Nothing else in email coz Bot program does not read any thing else .



## Disciplane 

### Time allocation

If one spends 
```
Mon - Fri : 2.5 hours/day -> 2.5 x 5 days  = 12.5
Sat - Sun : 5 hours/day   -> 5   x 2 days = 10

Total hours/week : 22.5 
Total hours/month : 90 hours 
```

That is `express Track ` , the other one is regular (slow?) Track that is 40 hours/week .

for Each level you can have in a different Track, say 'Pawn 1' express track,  `Pawn 2` regular track etc.. But once you start a LEVEL you should finish
it in the same Track .

 
If you are a student or employee and you can not get those 22 hours/week, share how your time is allocated as of today, community may suggest you
how to get your tasks done in less time or all together ditch those time wasting tasks ( FB, Social media etc..)

We all need 8 hours sleep, 2 hours total for other essentials like ( eating food + shower + etc ). Anything else  that begs your time you have to question .

## Lessons

### Lesson 1

What constitutes a language ?

`grammer :` rules that dictates what should be where

He is a good boy <br>
good boy he is

`vocabulary `


| Language | Grammer | Vocabulary |
| ------- |  -----   | ----  | 
| English | He is a good boy | good  | 
| English | a good boy is he  - `bad grammer`|   | 
| English | The tone of her speech was commendable| commendable  | 
| ------- |          | ----  |
| python  |  if age > 20:    | if  , print() , list()    |



| what      | Notes |
| -------   |  ----- |
|`variable `|  any value |
|           |  a , name , age , fruit |
| `expression`| expression has a value , meaning It evaluates to a value |
|             |variable + number ,  varible - number , variable * variable ,  variable + expression |
|`assignment ` | binding a value to variable name |
|              | age = 20 ,  number = 5 , value = 20 + 5 |




do some 7th grade math problem with steps, to show variable concept 

# making [egg omlet  steps take from here](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+make+egg+omelet&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS738US738&oq=how+to+make+egg+om&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l5.8712j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
1. have a bowl
2. have 2 eggs
3. have onion, salt , pepper powder
4. have a pan, slowly heat it on stove
4. beat eggs into bowl
5. chop oninon into small pieces
6. add onion pieces into bowl

```python

number = 5
number = number + 3

age = 20
age = age + 4

age = age - 2

# so it is sequence of steps going from top to bottom .



# Bank balance problem
balnce = 200


print(balnce - 20)

print ( balance)

balancenow = balance - 20
print(balancenow)
```
  
## what is out there

### youtube python Learn 
 - [top ex google guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWek49wXGzI)
 - [100k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uCXIbkbDSE) -- too much discussion with high level/low level langs etc. , jumped to functions 
 - [2013 video 500k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkx5_MRAV3A) -- tried examples in python console 
 - 
 - I think with out LEARNER doing his own exercises, it will be hard to retain & learn and re-produce ..
 - In a video setting , it is difficult to have interative session, where as in website setting it can be done .. SO WE HAVE a SHOT .
