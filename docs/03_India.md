## Charity work in India

Model : what can you for your cournty ? 
```
 - what can you for your community/cournty ?
 - 100 hours/year Charity, sweat work, no money required .
 - 10 hours/months , that is 100 hours/year ( assume missing 2 months in a year)
 - 1/3 ownership: people sweat, government , Sponsors/Donors : each share 1/3 the cost of the project 
 - the fact is : govenment do not have money to solve all the problems, even it did not have money 
   to solve 10% of ALL the country problems. Like a middle class family Father do not have money to provide when his children need/wants.
 ```
 
### Projects
--------------------
1. Browsable ,Centralized  storage for 'Clenup this' posts
```
 - why: 
 - a) so all 'cleanup posts' are in one place by pincode. When people can search and see STATUS they can Really around it
 - b) makes it easy to get financial sponsors/donors once people see 'clean up' stats for their  STATE or District .
 
 -  store above posts from twitter posts into a YMAL format file with : url, location, data posted, who posted
 -  also gather from facebook also . see Ugly indian FB account
 -  Django, Mobx web site. Use ReactRocks and React component sites to grab 'ready to use UI components/libs'
 -  Involve, IIT/NIT and other collage students in development at later stage .
```

2. Involve Reputable people go get bigger community
```
 - talk and get input from people such as : Veeramachinani ,  Ugly Indian Bangalore, etc .. 
 - see if they can take part , indirectly if not diretctly
 - need to solve a problem in a city like Vijayawada/Guntur : need to talk to municipal ex. employees who can advise 
 - need funds to privately fund a old 3 wheeler AUTO to haul grabage, or get municipal coordination ( like they do in bangalore)

```

Have a cell phone app to upload photos, and a facebook social login account web site so people edit and add more descriptions
Have profile by PIN code, so others can see same pics for that Pin code .
Have statuses of case number :
  case # : 522508-GARBAGE-001 : Garbage cleanup 001 in that pincode
  status :  created , verified , approved-for-fixing, declined , low-priority, work-in-progress, work-finished

  The_Ugly_Indian (founded 2010) : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ugly_Indian 
 
  The Ugly Indian's philosophy is "Kaam chalu mooh bandh. Stop Talking, Start Working." 
   ```
  Guidelines for volunteers:
  
  No lectures, no moralising, no activism, no self-righteous anger.
  No confrontation, no arguments, no debates, no pamphlets, no advocacy.
  Don’t step on anyone’s toes, don’t take sides in any ideological debates.
  Support existing systems and improve their effectiveness for the greater good.
  Basically, get real. Treat everyone with sincerity, respect and dignity first, and the greater good will be an outcome."[2]
 
TUI recognises the spot-fix as a success only if:

It lasts for at least 90 days.
It requires no ongoing supervision.
It is low-cost (ideally free) and easy to implement and replicate
It changes the behaviour and attitudes of all concerned
It creates minimal disruption in the daily actions of everyone concerned (nobody should lose a job, lose a source of income, or get seriously inconvenienced – because it takes only one Ugly Indian to undo the good work of a hundred others.[2]

----------
A small committed volunteer team transforms an ugly spot on Bengaluru's Richmond Road. 

This spot has festered here for years - it needed someone to take that first step and plunge in. 
All it took was 2 hours of silent, hard work - what a transformation!

```
BBMP installed a new Semi-Underground Waste Drop-Box at this location - as part of a larger solution to create clean streets

. When citizens and government work together,  real change happens.
Great example set by Nagawara residents!
