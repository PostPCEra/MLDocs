  The Ugly Indian's philosophy is "Kaam chalu mooh bandh. Stop Talking, Start Working." 
   ```
  Guidelines for volunteers:
  
  No lectures, no moralising, no activism, no self-righteous anger.
  No confrontation, no arguments, no debates, no pamphlets, no advocacy.
  Don’t step on anyone’s toes, don’t take sides in any ideological debates.
  Support existing systems and improve their effectiveness for the greater good.
  Basically, get real. Treat everyone with sincerity, respect and dignity first, and the greater good will be an outcome."[2]
 
TUI recognises the spot-fix as a success only if:

It lasts for at least 90 days.
It requires no ongoing supervision.
It is low-cost (ideally free) and easy to implement and replicate
It changes the behaviour and attitudes of all concerned
It creates minimal disruption in the daily actions of everyone concerned (nobody should lose a job, lose a source of income, or get seriously inconvenienced – because it takes only one Ugly Indian to undo the good work of a hundred others.[2]

A small committed volunteer team transforms an ugly spot on Bengaluru's Richmond Road. 

This spot has festered here for years - it needed someone to take that first step and plunge in. 
All it took was 2 hours of silent, hard work - what a transformation!

BBMP installed a new Semi-Underground Waste Drop-Box at this location - as part of a larger solution to create clean streets

. When citizens and government work together,  real change happens.
Great example set by Nagawara residents!
