**move PRD & Docusarus to Bitbucket** , start using Digital ocean 2 month credit with Django/Ansible ..

### 1. Live programming 
- It has both LPM and step back & step forward (when I tested)
- change top box to text as  "Write code in `Python 3`" , remove all top & bottom text
- let it work with above changes on Flask, then make it work on Django

### 2. User Registration & Login
- Provising & config of Django with Ansible (from the git repo). No Docker things at this time
- selection of User registration (China onlineJudge codebase, combine this with Django allauth for Social Login)

### 3. Pedagogy
- daily effort 1 hr min ( preferably in one sitting) 
- finish TEST at the end of session EVERY DAY ( should be strictly followed)
- weekend Tests
- peer grading
- write in your own words what a FOR , IF means ; write a real world analogy ( version it & let them see 1 month old def of FOR , IF).

For our ML Python Course learing:
  - we comeup with similar A1 .. C2 6 six levels
  - for Column headings : we wil have ( see more from programirz etc.. )

### 7. animation 
- see old research on animation 
 
 ## Version 2 features
 
 ### 1. autocompletion
 - It may be good to add this RealTime web editor of python tutor
 - `Jedi ` library seems [best one]() , used by Atom, Sublime Text,  
 - Jedi can currently be used with the following editors/projects: 
 - some web specic (not desktop) implementaionts : [on Atom](https://atom.io/packages/autocomplete-python-jedi), working with [wdb](https://github.com/Kozea/wdb)
 
 ### 2. web debugger
 - pythontutor only provides step thru, if advanced user wanted to tinker with `python interacitve shell` like we do one on PC/Mac installed python
  we can not do, but with this WDB we can same on the web
 - wdb : An improbable [web debugger through WebSockets](https://github.com/Kozea/wdb)
 - seems you can debug Flask, Django webserver code also ...
